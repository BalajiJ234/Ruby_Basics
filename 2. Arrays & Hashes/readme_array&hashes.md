##Array and its Methods.(240+). There are lot of array methods are in Ruby:

    *array.uniq #It will eliminate duplicate data
    *array.take(n) #It will returns the first 'n' Elements of an array.
    *array.drop(n) #It will returns the remove first 'n' Elements of an arrays.
    *array.push(n) or array<<(n) #add a new element at last of the array
    *array.unshift(n) #add a new element at the beginning of an Array
    *array.insert(i,n) #add a new element(n) at any position(i) in an array.
    *array.pop #remove the last element
    *array.shift #remove the first element
    *array.delete(n) #remeove the element

In IRB, by using this command [].methods, we can list the all arrays methods.
