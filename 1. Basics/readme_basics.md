##variables and Names

When I wrote this program the first time I had a mistake, and Ruby told me about it like this:

There are 100 cars available.
There are only 30 drivers available.
There will be 70 empty cars today.
ex4.rb:14: undefined local variable or method `carpool_capacity' for
    main:Object (NameError)
Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain why?

  Answer:

##Arguments
The ARGV is the "argument variable," a very standard name in programming that you will find used in many other languages. This variable holds the arguments you pass to your Ruby script when you run it. In this exercise you will get to play with this more and see what happens.

##Reading the files In two ways:
  * ARGV
  * $stdin.gets.chomps

##Reading and Writing the files:

  * close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
  * read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
  * readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
  * truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
  * write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.
  * seek(0) -- Move the read/write location to the beginning of the file.
